[["chapter-2-binomial-distribution.html", "Chapter 2: Binomial Distribution", " Chapter 2: Binomial Distribution A binomial distribution describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials, each with the same probability of success \\(p\\). We write: \\[ X \\sim B(n, p) \\] where: \\(n\\) is the number of trials (e.g., number of droplets in ddPCR), \\(p\\) is the probability of success in each trial, \\(X\\) is the number of successful trials (positive droplets). Example Letâ€™s consider a simple example using dice. Suppose we roll a die 3 times and count how many times we get a multiple of 3 (i.e., 3 or 6). This is a Bernoulli trial repeated 3 times, with: \\[ p = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}, \\quad n = 3 \\] We are interested in the distribution of \\(X\\) = number of successes (i.e., times we get a 3 or 6). The binomial probability mass function is: \\[ P(X = x) = \\binom{n}{x} p^x (1 - p)^{n - x} \\] R Example: Computing Probabilities x &lt;- 0:3 px &lt;- dbinom(x, size = 3, prob = 1/3) px ## [1] 0.29629630 0.44444444 0.22222222 0.03703704 These correspond to: \\(P(X = 0)\\) = 0.296 (no successes) \\(P(X = 1)\\) = 0.444 (one success) \\(P(X = 2)\\) = 0.222 (two successes) \\(P(X = 3)\\) = 0.037 (all three are successes) Visualizing the Binomial Distribution Figure 1.1: binominal distribution Interpretation in ddPCR In ddPCR, each droplet is a Bernoulli trial: either positive or negative for the target DNA. When considering multiple droplets, the total number of positive droplets follows a binomial distribution. This distribution becomes particularly useful when modeling the number of positive droplets across many replicates, before transitioning to Poisson-based modeling for rare events.
