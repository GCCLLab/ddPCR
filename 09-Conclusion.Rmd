# Chapter 9: Conclusion {.unnumbered}

Digital PCR (ddPCR) represents a significant advancement in nucleic acid quantification by enabling absolute measurements without the need for standard curves.\
Through precise partitioning and the application of Poisson statistics, ddPCR offers unparalleled sensitivity and reproducibility in genomic analysis.

In this book, we covered:

-   The mathematical foundation of ddPCR using Bernoulli, Binomial, and Poisson models\
-   How to estimate copy number and concentration from droplet counts\
-   The relationship between copy per droplet (CPD) and detection probability\
-   Methods to calculate confidence intervals and define detection limits\
-   Applications in CNV analysis and rare allele quantification\
-   Quality control strategies to ensure reliable ddPCR results

Whether used for cancer diagnostics, gene dosage analysis, or pathogen detection, ddPCR provides a powerful, robust, and accessible platform for molecular biology.

We hope this resource has provided you with both the theoretical understanding and practical tools to confidently apply ddPCR in your own research or clinical workflows.
