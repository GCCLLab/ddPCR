# Chapter 8: Quality Control and Best Practices in ddPCR {.unnumbered}

While digital PCR (ddPCR) provides highly precise quantification, ensuring data quality requires careful experimental design, appropriate controls, and post-run validation.  
This chapter outlines essential quality control (QC) considerations and best practices to ensure reliable and reproducible ddPCR results.

**1. Droplet Quality and Thresholding**
-   **Minimum Droplet Count**:
    A minimum of **10,000 accepted droplets per well** is recommended for statistically robust quantification.\
    Fewer droplets result in wider confidence intervals and increased error.

-   **Rain Detection**:
    "Rain" refers to droplets with intermediate fluorescence that fall between the positive and negative peaks.\
    These droplets may result from:

    -   Poor probe or primer efficiency
    -   Suboptimal thermal cycling
    -   Sample degradation or inhibition

> Inspection and adjusting thresholds may be necessary.

**2. Controls**

-   **No Template Control (NTC)**:
    Included in every run to monitor contamination.
    Expected result: **0 positive droplets**.

-   **Positive Control**:
    A sample with a known concentration of target DNA, used to confirm assay performance.

-   **Reference Gene Control**:
    In CNV assays, use a **stable reference gene** (e.g., RPP30 or RNaseP) to normalize copy number.

**3. Assessing Reproducibility**

Run **technical replicates** to ensure precision and identify potential outliers.

```{r}
replicates <- c(10.2, 10.4, 9.9)
mean(replicates) 
sd(replicates) 
cv <- sd(replicates) / mean(replicates) * 100
round(cv, 2) # CV (%) < 10% is ideal
```

**4. False Positives and False Negatives**

| Error Type | Possible Cause | Mitigation Strategy |
|------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|
| False Positive | Contamination, misclassified "rain" droplets | Use strict NTC, adjust threshold |
| False Negative | Poor droplet generation, failed amplification | Increase input DNA, optimize conditions |

> For rare mutation detection, even a single false positive can affect interpretation â€” validation is essential.

**5. LoD Confirmation via Dilution Series**

To confirm the Limit of Detection (LoD), use a serial dilution of a known template and assess the lowest concentration at which detection is consistent.

-   Run 3 or more replicates per dilution level
-   LoD is typically the lowest level at which all replicates are positive

| Practice             | Recommendation                          |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Droplet Count        | \>10,000 per well                       |
| NTC                  | Should have 0 positive droplets         |
| Positive Control     | Include known copy number sample        |
| Replicates           | Use technical duplicates or triplicates |
| Threshold Inspection | Adjust for rain manually if needed      |
| LoD Validation       | Perform dilution series experiments     |

By incorporating these best practices, we can minimize experimental variability, reduce false results, and ensure that ddPCR data are reliable and publication-ready.
